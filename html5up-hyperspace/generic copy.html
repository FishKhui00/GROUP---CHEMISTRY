			<div class="image fit"><img src="/images/images/JOHNDALTONS.jpg" alt="" height="300" width="20" /></div>
			<p><strong>Biography:</strong> John Dalton (born September 5 or 6, 1766, Eaglesfield, Cumberland, England—died July 27, 1844, Manchester) English meteorologist and chemist, a pioneer in the development of modern atomic theory. In 1793, John Dalton moved to Manchester to teach mathematics at a dissenting academy. He brought with him a manuscript of his first book, "Meteorological Observations and Essays," which contained original ideas that marked the transition of meteorology from a casual topic to a serious scientific pursuit. Born and raised in England's Lake District, Dalton observed various meteorological phenomena and advocated for the view that the atmosphere was a physical mixture of approximately 80% nitrogen and 20% oxygen, contrary to contemporary opinion. He also measured the capacity of the air to absorb water vapor and the variation of its partial pressure with temperature. Dalton defined partial pressure as the pressure that a constituent in a mixture of gases would exert if it were the only gas present. His contributions to the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society included a description of his own and his brother's color blindness, which was later known as Daltonism.</p>
			<p><div><img src="/images/images/Solid sphere.jpg" alt="" class="image left"></div> <strong>Model:</strong> Dalton drew upon the Ancient Greek idea of atoms(the word 'atom'comes from the Greek'atomos'meaning indivisible). His theory stated that atoms are indivisible,those of a given element are identical,and compounds are combinations of different types of atoms.</p>

			<div class="image fit"><img src="/images/images/JJ Thomson.jpg" alt="" height="50" width="50" /></div>
			<p><strong>Biography:</strong> J.J. Thomson (born December 18, 1856, Cheetham Hill, near Manchester, England—died August 30, 1940, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire) English physicist who helped revolutionize the knowledge of atomic structure by his discovery of the electron (1897). He received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1906 and was knighted in 1908.With this new subatomic particle, J. J. Thomson produced a new atomic model, or atomic theory, concerning the structure of the atom. Thomson’s theory is now known as the plum pudding atomic model or Thomson atomic model. The atom was visually thought of as a uniformly positively charged mass (the “pudding” or “dough”) with the electrons scattered throughout (like “plums”) to balance the charges. The plum pudding model proved incorrect, but it offered the first attempt at incorporating a subatomic particle into an atomic theory. In 1911, Ernest Rutherford — a former student of J. J. Thomson — proved this theory incorrect by experimenting and hypothesizing the nucleus.</p>
			<p><div><img src="/images/images/PLUMPUDDING.jpg" alt="" class="image left" width="198" height="198"></div> <strong>Model:</strong> Thomson discovered electrons (which he called'corpuscles) in a Nobel Prize. He subsequently produced the 'plum pudding' model of the atom. It shows the atom as composed of electrons scattered throughout a spherical cloud of positive charge</p>

				<p><strong>Biography:</strong> Niels Bohr, (born October 7, 1885, Copenhagen, Denmark—died November 18, 1962, Copenhagen), Danish physicist who is generally regarded as one of the foremost physicists of the 20th century. He was the first to apply the quantum concept, which restricts the energy of a system to certain discrete values, to the problem of atomic and molecular structure. For that work he received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1922.

			<div class="image fit"><img src="/images/images/Schrodinger.jpg" alt="" /></div>
			<p><strong>Biography:</strong> Erwin Schrödinger (born August 12, 1887, Vienna, Austria—died January 4, 1961, Vienna) Austrian theoretical physicist who contributed to the wave theory of matter and to other fundamentals of quantum mechanics. He shared the 1933 Nobel Prize for Physics with British physicist P.A.M. Dirac.Erwin Schrödinger earned his doctorate from the University of Vienna in 1910 and began working as a researcher at the Second Physics Institute there. He served in the military during World War I and then moved to the University of Zürich in 1921, where he developed the foundations of quantum wave mechanics at the age of 39. In a six-month period in 1926, Schrödinger introduced a wave equation, now known as the Schrödinger equation, based on Louis de Broglie's proposal that particles of matter have a dual nature. The solutions to this equation are wave functions that represent probabilities rather than definite events, replacing the visualized sequences of events in classical mechanics with a more abstract notion of probability.</p>
			<p><div><img src="/images/images/QuantumModel.jpg" alt="" class="image left" width="198" height="198"></div> <strong>Model:</strong> Schrodinger stated that electrons do not move in set paths around the nucleus, but in waves. It is impossible to know the exact location of the electrons;instead, we have 'clouds of probability' called orbitals, in which we are more likely to find an electron</p>

		<div class="image fit"><img src="/images/images/pasteur.jpg" alt="" /></div>
		<p><strong>Biography:</strong>27 December 1822 – 28 September 1895) was a French chemist and microbiologist renowned for his discoveries of the principles of vaccination, microbial fermentation, and pasteurization, the last of which was named after him.  </p>
		<p><strong>Contributions:</strong>His research in chemistry led to remarkable breakthroughs in the understanding of the causes and preventions of diseases, which laid down the foundations of hygiene, public health and much of modern medicine. Pasteur's works are credited with saving millions of lives through the developments of vaccines for rabies and anthrax. He is regarded as one of the founders of modern bacteriology and has been honored as the "father of bacteriology" and the "father of microbiology".  </p>
		<p><div><img src="/images/images/Louis_Pasteur_model.png" alt="" class="image left" width="198" height="198"></div> <strong>Model:</strong>Pasteur was responsible for disproving the doctrine of spontaneous generation. Under the auspices of the French Academy of Sciences, his experiment demonstrated that in sterilized and sealed flasks, nothing ever developed; conversely, in sterilized but open flasks, microorganisms could grow. His many experiments showed that diseases could be prevented by killing or stopping germs, thereby directly supporting the germ theory and its application in clinical medicine. He is best known to the general public for his invention of the technique of treating milk and wine to stop bacterial contamination, a process now called pasteurization.   </p>

		<div class="image fit"><img src="/images/images/Avogadro.png" alt="" /></div>
		<p><strong>Biography:</strong>9 August 1776 – 9 July 1856) was an Italian scientist, he published an article with the title Essai d'une manière de déterminer les masses relatives des molécules élémentaires des corps, et les proportions selon lesquelles elles entrent dans ces combinaisons ("Essay on a manner of Determining the Relative Masses of the Elementary Molecules of Bodies and the Proportions by Which They Enter These Combinations"), which contains Avogadro's hypothesis. Avogadro submitted this essay to Jean-Claude Delamétherie's Journal de Physique, de Chimie et d'Histoire naturelle ("Journal of Physics, Chemistry and Natural History").  </p>
		<p><strong>Contributions:</strong>Known for his contribution to molecular theory now known as Avogadro's law, which states that equal volumes of gases under the same conditions of temperature and pressure will contain equal numbers of molecules. In tribute to him, the ratio of the number of elementary entities (atoms, molecules, ions or other particles) in a substance to its amount of substance (the latter having the unit mole), 6.02214076×1023 mol−1, is known as the Avogadro constant.  </p>
		<p><div><img src="/images/images/mole-avogadros-model.jpg" alt="" class="image left" width="198" height="198"></div> <strong>Model:</strong>The Avogadro constant, commonly denoted NA or L, is an SI defining constant with an exact value of 6.02214076×1023 mol-1 (reciprocal moles). It is defined as the number of constituent particles (usually molecules, atoms, or ions) per mole (SI unit) and used as a normalization factor in the amount of substance in a sample. In practice, its value is often approximated as 6.02×1023 mol-1 or 6.022×1023 mol-1. The constant is named after the physicist and chemist Amedeo Avogadro (1776–1856).
			The Avogadro constant NA is also the factor that converts the average mass of one particle, in grams, to the molar mass of the substance, in grams per mole (g/mol). </p>
